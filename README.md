## 🌌 Why LootMeteor?
Random events keep players engaged. **LootMeteor** isn't just a loot drop; it's a visual spectacle. Watch fireballs descend from the sky with particle trails, explode upon impact, and fight for the loot inside the obsidian crater. Best of all? The crater heals itself automatically.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🔥 Epic Visuals & Physics**
    * Meteors fall with **Flame, Lava, and Smoke** particle trails.
    * Realistic explosion sounds and impact effects upon landing.
    * Creates a temporary crater surrounded by fire and obsidian.

* **♻️ Smart Terrain Regeneration**
    * Don't worry about map damage! The plugin takes a snapshot of the terrain before impact.
    * Craters automatically regenerate after a configurable time (default: 10 mins).

* **💎 Custom Loot GUI**
    * Manage loot tables easily in-game.
    * Run `/lm edit` to drag-and-drop items into the loot pool with configurable drop chances.

* **⚙️ Highly Configurable**
    * Customize spawn intervals, fall speed, explosion power, and detection radius.
    * "Protected Chests" option prevents players from breaking the loot container instantly.
